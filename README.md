# HyperEmitter &nbsp;&nbsp;[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mcollina/hyperemitter.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mcollina/hyperemitter)

HyperEmitter is a horizontally scalable __and__ persistent EventEmitter powered by a [Merkle DAG](http://npm.im/hyperlog).
(Yes, it's like a blockchain). In other contexts, this concept is also called an EventStore. HyperEmitter
uses [protocol-buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), specifically
[mafintosh's](https://github.com/mafintosh/protocol-buffers) implementation, for handling message schemas, although custom codecs are also supported.

> This module is __highly experimental__, __possibly under-perfoming__, and __may have bugs__, use with
> caution. On the other end, if the thought of a persistent, horizontally scaleable EventStore gets you
> excite please jump in wherever you feel you can help!

## Installation
To install the module for use locally in your project use:

```
npm install hyperemitter --save
```

To install the companion CLI tool, you will need to install globally:

```
npm install hyperemitter -g
```

## Example
The example below can be found and ran from the [examples](./examples/) folder; it demonstrates
how to connect two HyperEmitters together and how they both receive all messages sent.

```javascript
'use strict'

var fs = require('fs')
var path = require('path')

// The emitter itself as well as an in memory
// leveldb based store, any leveldb store will do.
var HyperEmitter = require('../hyperemitter')
var buildDB = require('memdb')

// use the example-schema.proto as the message schema.
var schema = fs.readFileSync(path.join('.', 'example-schema.proto'))

// two emitters will be used for this example, notice each
// maintains it's own leveldb store and share the same schema.
var emitterOne = new HyperEmitter(buildDB('a'), schema)
var emitterTwo = new HyperEmitter(buildDB('b'), schema)

// listen on port 9001, ensure no connection error.
emitterOne.listen(9901, function (err) {
  if (err) { return }

  // connect to the first emitter.
  emitterTwo.connect(9901, '127.0.0.1', function (err) {
    if (err) { return }
  })

  // basic message type
  var userAddedMsg = {
    id: 1,
    username: 'user'
  }

  // basic message type
  var userRemovedMsg = {
    id: 1
  }

  // Messages sent on either emitter will be handled.
  emitterOne.on('userRemoved', function (msg) {
    console.log('userRemoved: ', msg)
  })

  // Messages sent on either emitter will be handled.
  emitterTwo.on('userAdded', function (msg) {
    console.log('userAdded: ', msg)
  })

  // We send each message across the opposite emitter.
  emitterOne.emit('userAdded', userAddedMsg)
  emitterTwo.emit('userRemoved', userRemovedMsg)

  function complete () {
    emitterOne.close()
    emitterTwo.close()
  }

  // we will wait for 500ms to see if more than one
  // message is delivered to the subscribers above.
  setTimeout(complete, 500)
})
```

## Using The CLI Tool
HyperEmitter comes with a nice CLI to work with other remote HyperEmitter's. Also, it doubles
as really useful tool for debugging. The sample below uses the schema in `test/fixture/`.

```
hypem --db db --port 1234 fixture/messages.proto
```

On pressing enter, you should see output similar to the following:

```
listening on 1234 127.0.0.1
EventPeer  { id: '123', addresses: [ { ip: 'localhost', port: 1234 } ] }
```

From here you can then use the provided REPL to work with HyperEmitter:

```javascript
hyper.emit('Hello', { from: 'Matteo' })
```

And receive the following response:

```
Hello { from: 'Matteo', message: '' }
```

To connect another hyperEmitter in another shell:

```
hypem --db db2 --target-port 1234 fixture/messages.proto
```

Which will output the following:

```
connected to localhost 1234
EventPeer { id: '123', addresses: [ { ip: 'localhost', port: 1234 } ] }
Hello { from: 'Matteo', message: '' }
```

As you can see the events are synced up!

To export the data in [newline delimited json](http://ndjson.org/), use:

```
hypem --no-repl --db db4 --target-port 1234 fixture/messages.proto
```

Which will produce output like so:

```
{"name":"EventPeer","payload":{"id":"123","addresses":[{"ip":"localhost","port":1234}]}}
{"name":"Hello","payload":{"from":"Matteo","message":""}}
```

The cli tool also works as a input stream, following the UNIX philosophy. If you close a REPL or a ndjson stream,
the next time it will start where it stopped. If you have a stream, you can start back from the beginning using
the `--from-scratch` flag.

<a name="hyperemitter"></a>
### HyperEmitter(db, schema, [opts])
HyperEmitter is both the name of the module and of the function to be required. The function is actually
a class or a class factory depending on how it is used. The code below shows both valid ways to get a
new instance of HyperEmitter for use:

```
var emitterOne = Hyperemitter(someDb, someSchema)
var emitterTwo = new HyperEmitter(someDb, someSchema)
```

 * ##### _db_
 The `db` argument accepts a [levelup](http://npm.im/levelup) instance, which in turn is powered by
 [leveldb](). We recommend [level](http://npm.im/level) for persistent storage and
 [memdb](http://npm.im/memdb) if you require an in memory store.

 * ##### _schema_
 An string or stream that represents all of the messages to support in a given instance of HyperEmitter.

 * ##### _opts_
 An optional object that can be provided to configure the created instance. All available
 options are listed below.

  * ___reconnectTimeout:___ The timeout that this instance will wait before reconnecting to peers.

---

### .messages <a name="messages"></a>
Message types are stored in the `.messages` field for each instance created. This field is populated
with a normalized object based on the schema provided. Each property represents a single message, indvidual
messages, as well as their encoder and decoder can be accessed from here.

``` js
var emitter = HyperEmitter(someDb, someSchema)

// the object containing each message as a property
var messages = emitter.messages

// access an individual message by it's name
var message = messages[messageName]

// access a given message's encode / decode functions
var encoder = message.encode
var decode = message.decode
```

---

### .emit(event, message, [callback]) <a name="emit"></a>
Messages can be emitted from HyperEmitter using the `.emit()` method. This method takes the name of the
event to be emitted and validates `message` against the schema before sending it off to any listening
subscribers, in parallel. Once complete the `callback` function is called, if present.

 * ##### _event_
 The name of one of the message definitions from the provided schema.

 * ##### _message_
 Any object who's shape matches the named event. It's keys are validated against the schema.

 * ##### _callback_
 An optional function that will be called once the emitted message has been added to the log.

---

### .registerCodec(name, codec | codecs) <a name="registerCodec"></a>
Custom codecs can be registered as long as they have both an `encode` and `decode` method. Codecs
are keyed by message name. For ease of use registration params can be provided as args (name,
codec), an object, or an array of `{name: '', codec: obj}`. Only once codec can be registered against one message at any given time.

 * ##### _name_
 The name of the message message this codec handles.

 * ##### _codec_
 Any object which has an `encode` and `decode` method.

 * ##### _codecs_
 An object or array which represents a collection of codecs and their names.

---

<a name="on"></a>
### .on(event, callback(message[, done]))
Subscribes to and provides a function to be called each time and event is raised.

 * ##### _event_
 The name of the event being subscribed to.

 * ##### _callback_
 The function to be called when a new event is raised. The `message` arg holds the message emitted. The
 `done` arg can be used for letting the emitter know when the function has completed the handling of
 the event.

---

<a name="removeListener"></a>
### .removeListener(event, callback(message[, done]))
Removes the listener who matches the one provided. This method does not work with anonymous functions, only a
function with a prior reference can be removed.

 * ##### _event_
 The name of the event the listener is subscribed to.

 * ##### _callback_
 The reference of the function originally used in the `.on` call.

---

<a name="connect"></a>
### .connect(port, host[, done])
Connects this HyperEmitter with another one which we call a peer. Peers can exist on other machines, HyperEmitter
will communicate over TCP using the `host` and `port` provided. An optional function can be provided that will be
called once the connection has been made.

 * ##### _port_
 The port of the machine the peer to connect to resides on

 * ##### _host_
 The host of the machine the peer to connect to resides on.

 * ##### _done_
 A function to be called when connected.

---

<a name="listen"></a>
### .listen(port[, host[, done]])
Listen on a given port/host combination. An `EventPeer` event will be
emitter.

 * ##### _port_
 The port to listen on.

 * ##### _host_
 The host to listen on.

 * ##### _done_
 An optional function to be called one listening has begun.

---

<a name="stream"></a>
### .stream([opts])
A Duplex stream to emit and receive events.

 * ##### _opts_
 An optional object of settings.

  * `from:` The point in the stream to return events since. supports 'beginning'

---

<a name="close"></a>
### .close(callback)
Close a given HyperEmitter. After, all `emit` will return an error.

 * ##### _callback_

 An optional function to be called when close has completed.
